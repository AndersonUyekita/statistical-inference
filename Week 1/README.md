## Class Notes

### Module 1 – Introductory video

Statistical Inference Definitions:

> -   The process of generating conclusions about a population from a
>     noisy sample.
> -   Statistical inference is the process of drawing formal conclusions
>     from data.

### Module 2 – Probability

> In this module we discuss probability, the foundation of statistical
> analysis. Probability assigns a number between 0 and 1 to events to
> give a sense of the “chance” of the event. Probability has become our
> default model for apparently random phenomena. Our eventual goal is to
> use probability models, our formal mechanism for connecting our data
> to a population. However, before we get to probability models, we need
> to understand the basics of probability calculus. The next few
> lectures cover these basics.
